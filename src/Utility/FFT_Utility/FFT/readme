The pfft routines are the updated .f90 Fast-Fourier-Transform
routines for real and complex transforms in lines, x-array format
and in y-array format. They relace the nfft suite, which pre-dates
the availability of the useful .f90 features now included. 

cfft, dfft: complex data transform and its inverse
rfft, hfft: real data transform and its inverse

test2:      Examples showing idioms for Fourier differentiation and integration
test3:      Example showing the idiom needed to convolve a pair of 1D arrays
test4:      Example showing how to use slow fourier evaluation, hsfe, (real)
test5:      Example, like test4, but use complex slow evaluation routines
