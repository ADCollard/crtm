Overview
--------

The files contained in the library are as follows:

solar.kurucz.rad.mono.full_disk.bin - Binary solar irradiance spectrum
                      for the full solar disk. Spectral range spans
                      50.000043-49999.933236 cm-1. Spectral resolution
                      ranges from 0.0001 cm-1 at 50.000043 cm-1 to
                      0.1 cm-1 at 49999.933236 cm-1. Units are W/(m2
                      cm-1).


solar.kurucz.rad.1cm-1binned.full_disk.asc - ASCII solar irradiance
                      spectrum for the full solar disk degraded to
                      1 cm-1 spacing from the file
                      "solar.kurucz.rad.mono.full_disk.bin". Spectral
                      range spans 50.-50000. cm-1. Each 1 cm-1 bin is
                      centered about an integer wavenumber value.
                      Units are W/(m2 cm-1).


solar.kurucz.rad.mono.0.4R.bin - Binary solar irradiance spectrum for
                      the central 16% of the solar disk (normalized to
                      the solid angle 6.8e-5 sr of the full disk).
                      Spectral range spans 999.901587-10010.006856 cm-1.
                      Spectral resolution ranges from 0.002 cm-1 at
                      999.901587 cm-1 to 0.006 cm-1 at 10010.006856
                      cm-1. Units are W/(m2 cm-1).

extract.f - Fortran program which extracts the binary solar data from
            a file called "solar.bin" (which can be either of the
            above binary files) and writes the spectra directly or
            interpolated to a user-defined grid (input via the file
            SOLAR_control) in ascii or LBLRTM binary format.

SOLAR_control - Input control file for the extract program. The
                instructions are as follows:

Record 1: Holerith description of file

Record 2: Flag for inteprolation of simple extraction of data
          "extract" extracts the desired spectra at the Kurucz
                    sampling
          "interpl" extracts and interpolates the data to a
                    user-specified grid

Record 3: Flag for output format of data
        "ascii2" outputs ascii file with one frequency and solar
                 source value per record (two columns) - Kurucz format
        "ascii1" outputs ascii file with one solar source value per
                 record (one column)
        "asciib" outputs ascii file blocks of 80 values

         *** NOTE: All ascii output files contain a descriptive file
                   header with the following information:

	    For cases with "extract" selected, the header consists of

	    V1, V2, VC1, NPTS, SOL_MIN, SOL_MAX, SOL_INT

            V1 = starting wavenumber value in selected spectrum
            V2 = ending wavenumber value in selected spectrum
            VC1 = constant used to define spectral grid, 
                  where the spectral value
                  v_i = v1*exp(vc1*(i-1)*1.e-6)
            NPTS = total number of values output
            SOL_MIN = minumum solar value output
            SOL_MAX = maximum solar value output
            SOL_INT = integrated output solar spectrum value

            For cases with "interpl" selected, the header consists of

            V1, V2, DV, NPTS, SOL_MIN, SOL_MAX, SOL_INT

            V1 = starting wavenumber value in selected spectrum
            V2 = ending wavenumber value in selected spectrum
            DV = wavenumber spacing for interpolated result
            NPTS = total number of values output
            SOL_MIN = minumum solar value output
            SOL_MAX = maximum solar value output
            SOL_INT = integrated output solar spectrum value

        "binary" output binary file for use with LBLRTM for cflag =
                 'interpl' and a solar binary file for cflag =
                 'extract'

         *** NOTE: LBLRTM binary output files consist of a single file
                   header and, for every 2400 points, sets of panel
                   headers and data records. Solar binary output files
                   consist of a single file header and, for every 4000
                   points, sets of panel headers and data records.

Record 4: Full pathname of the output file

Record 5: Spectral range to be extracted or interpolated
        The format is as follows:

        For cases where the "extract" option is selected (Record 2)


	        VMIN, VMAX, SCALE_FAC

                VMIN: Starting wavenumber for extraction
                VMAX: Ending wavenumber for extraction
                SCALE_FAC: Scale factor applied to solar source
                      function (default value is 1.0)

        For cases where the "interpl" option is selected (Record 2)

	        VMIN, VMAX, DVOUT, SCALE_FAC

                VMIN: Starting wavenumber for extraction
                VMAX: Ending wavenumber for extraction
                DVOUT: Output grid spacing
                SCALE_FAC: Scale factor applied to solar source
                      function (default value is 1.0)


NOTE: All records following Record 5 are ignored. Several example cases
      are contained in the sample SOLAR_control file.
