\begin{abstract}
The transmittances used to generate the CompactOPTRAN model coefficients in the CRTM need to be preprocessed to ensure that they produce a physically reasonable result and that they can be fit in the regression scheme. Using the IASI instrument as a test platform, this article investigates how the transmittances due to different absorbers are combined to minimise the amount of correction required in the preprocessing.

\textbf{Keywords}: CRTM, CompactOPTRAN, effective transmittance, absorber combination.

\section{Introduction}
%=====================
In section \ref{x1-sec:correct_efftau} of \cite{CRTM_IASI_Transmittance} the need to ``correct'' the instrument resolution effective transmittances is explained. Here the problem is briefly restated.

In using the CompactOPTRAN atmospheric absorption algorithm in the CRTM, we fit, and then predict, the transmittances due to water vapour, ozone, and the ``dry'' gases separately. This is done at instrument resolution, so the polychromaticity of sensor channels becomes important (even for high spectral resolution instruments like AIRS and IASI). Completely non-physical effective transmittances are computed so that the product of the components give the same result as the line-by-line (LBL) computed total transmittance since it is the total transmittance that is used in the radiative transfer. But, the effective transmittances behave in some spectacularly bizarre ways and need to be corrected. This correction involves modifying the effective transmittance profiles using the following rules,
\begin{equation}
  \tau(k) = \begin{cases}
               0         & \textrm{if } \tau(k) < 0\\
               1         & \textrm{if } \tau(k) > 1\\
               \tau(k-1) & \textrm{if } \tau(k) > \tau(k-1)
            \end{cases}
  \label{eqn:fix_efftau}
\end{equation}
In addition, section \ref{x1-sec:absorber_combos} of \cite{CRTM_IASI_Transmittance} showed a single example of how different combinations of absorbers can be used to minimise the need to correct the effective transmittances. This document details how to minimise the occurrence of grossly anomalous effective transmittances by selecting different combinations of the LBL-generated component transmittances that produce well-behaved effective transmittances (in a radiometric sense). 


\section{Absorber combinations}
%==============================
Three different sets of effective transmittances are considered here:
\begin{list}{\bfseries}
  {\setlength{\labelwidth}{1.2in}
   \setlength{\leftmargin}{1.2in}
   \setlength{\labelsep}{0.1in}
   \setlength{\parsep}{0.5ex plus0.2ex minus0.1ex}
   \setlength{\itemsep}{0ex plus0.2ex}}
  \item[\bfseries WVO-derived:] Derived from the combined water vapour (wet) and ozone (ozo) transmittances
  \item[\bfseries DOZ-derived:] Derived from the combined dry gases (dry) and ozone transmittances
  \item[\bfseries WVD-derived:] Derived from the combined water vapour and dry gases transmittances
\end{list}

The \textbf{WVO-derived} transmittances are,
\begin{eqnarray}
  \efftaup{dry} = \frac{\taup{all}}{\taup{wvo}}\textrm{,} & \efftaup{ozo} = \displaystyle\frac{\taup{wvo}}{\taup{wet}} \textrm{, and} & \efftaup{wet} = \frac{\taup{wvo}}{\taup{ozo}}
\end{eqnarray}
the \textbf{DOZ-derived} transmittances are,
\begin{eqnarray}
  \efftaup{wet} = \frac{\taup{all}}{\taup{doz}}\textrm{,} & \efftaup{ozo} = \displaystyle\frac{\taup{doz}}{\taup{dry}} \textrm{, and} & \efftaup{dry} = \frac{\taup{doz}}{\taup{ozo}}
\end{eqnarray}
and the \textbf{WVD-derived} transmittances are,
\begin{eqnarray}
  \efftaup{ozo} = \frac{\taup{all}}{\taup{wvd}}\textrm{,} & \efftaup{dry} = \displaystyle\frac{\taup{wvd}}{\taup{wet}} \textrm{, and} & \efftaup{wet} = \frac{\taup{wvd}}{\taup{dry}}
\end{eqnarray}
For each derived set of transmittances, the total transmittance can be constructed from two different combinations of component transmittances based on which line-by-line (LBL) transmittance component is retained. The valid combinations are shown in table \ref{tab:derived_set_combo}. For further reference, each set will be referred to by its derived-set name and combination number. So, for example, the WVO-derived Combination 2 set of transmittances will be referred to WVO2; the WVD combination 1 set by WVD1, etc.
\begin{table}[htp]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{c | c | c}
    Derived Set & Combination 1 & Combination 2\\
    \hline
    WVO & $\taup{all}=\efftaup{dry}\cdot\efftaup{ozo}\cdot\taup{wet}$ (WVO1) & $\taup{all}=\efftaup{dry}\cdot \efftaup{wet}\cdot\taup{ozo}$ (WVO2)\\
    DOZ & $\taup{all}=\efftaup{wet}\cdot\efftaup{ozo}\cdot\taup{dry}$ (DOZ1) & $\taup{all}=\efftaup{wet}\cdot\efftaup{dry}\cdot\taup{ozo}$ (DOZ2)\\
    WVD & $\taup{all}=\efftaup{ozo}\cdot\efftaup{dry}\cdot\taup{wet}$ (WVD1) & $\taup{all}=\efftaup{ozo}\cdot\efftaup{wet}\cdot\taup{dry}$ (WVD2)
  \end{tabular}

\section{Brightness Temperature Residuals}
%=========================================
\label{sec:tb_residuals}
The total transmittance for each set shown in table \ref{tab:derived_set_combo} (with the effective transmittances corrected as in equation \ref{eqn:fix_efftau}) was used in a simple radiative transfer scheme to produce simulated clear sky brightness temperatures. For a given sensor channel \emph{l}, the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance was computed using,
\begin{equation}
  R_{l} = B_{l}(T_{sfc})\cdot\tau_{K,l} + \sum_{k=1}^{K}B_{l}(\bar{T}_{k})\cdot(\tau_{k,l}-\tau_{k-1,l})
\end{equation}
where $\tau_{0,l}$ = 1 and $K$ is the total number of atmospheric layers. Because the computed IASI transmittances were used, the radiances were converted to brightness temperatures using the Planck function directly (i.e. no polychromatic correction was done). The calculation was repeated for the LBL-computed total transmittances, and differenced with the result using the effective transmittance profiles to determine the radiometric impact of the effective transmittance ``corrections''.

Calculations were done for the IASI instrument at seven zenith angles ($sec(\theta_{Z})$ = 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2.0, 2.25, and 3.0) and all 48 profiles in the UMBC dependent profile set. For each instrument channel, the transmittance data set that minimised the residual brightness temperatures in a least squares sense was selected for that channel.

The minimum brightness temperature residual surface (displaying all angles and profiles) and the associated statistics (average, RMS, and maximum value) for all three IASI bands are shown in figures \ref{fig:iasiB1.min_dtb_sfc} through \ref{fig:iasiB3.min_dtb}. By selecting the best  transmittance data sets for any particular channel yields residuals that can be orders of magnitude smaller simply using a single set of transmittances. The feature most evident in the minimum residual plots is the ringing due to the IASI instrument apodisation.

For reference, the individual brightness temperature residual plots for each transmittance data set (WVO1 through WVD2) and each IASI band are shown in appendix \ref{app:dtb}.

\section{Impact on Regression Fit Residuals}
%===========================================
\subsection{IASI Band 1}
%-----------------------
The original brightness temperature residual bias and RMS statistics for IASI band 1 are shown in figure \ref{fig:old_iasiB1_stats}. These statistics are derived from regression fits to \emph{only} the WVO1 set of transmittances. Using different combinations of transmittance profiles based on the minimum residual as described in section \ref{sec:tb_residuals} as input to the regression fitting yields the residual statistics shown in figure \ref{fig:new_iasiB1_stats}.

The most noticeable change is the reduction in the biases for those handful of channels that had relatively large bias values. Unfortunately there was not a corresponding decrease in the residual RMS - some channels that have a large RMS did see a slight decrease, but nothing too significant in general.

Focusing on the dry (for now) RMS residuals of figure \ref{fig:new_iasiB1_stats}(d), there are several longwave channels between 700-780\invcm{} that stand out with particularly large values. Some of these frequencies, along with the transmittance combination use in the regression fit, are shown in table \ref{tab:bad_dry_channels.new_iasiB1_stats}.
