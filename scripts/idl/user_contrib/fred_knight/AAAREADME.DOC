This directory contains routines from Fred Knight (knight@ll.mit.edu).
All routines have built-in help, e.g., 

	IDL> junk = ddread(/help)

In addition, there is a file (fkk.help) that you can install in $IDL_DIR/help.
Just copy it to that directory and IDL will find it with the '?' command.
The contents of this file will be displayed with IDL's on-line help.
The files are the following.

README		this file

fkk.help	all the headers in a file made by using mk_library_help.pro

ddread.pro	This routine reads data in rows and columns.

legend.pro	This procedure makes a legend for a plot.

legendtest.pro	Test the legend procedure.

thecolor.pro	Function to rob a color index from the current color table
		and set it to the specified color.  Then return the index.
thecolor.txt	A text file containing named colors and their RGB values

nbytes.pro	Return the number of bytes in the variable---the actual
		number of bytes, not including the system-dependent padding
		for structures.

nlines.pro	Return the number of lines in a file

panelplot.pro	Plot many sets of variables on one common set of axes

ppi.pro		Make a ppi (plan position indicator) plot, named for the early
		CRT displays that presented radar data in polar coordinates. 

readb.pro	Procedure to copy the bits of an array to another IDL variable.

replicas.pro	Replicate an array, as replicate.pro does for scalars or structures.
		Replicas calls replicate if input is a scalar or structure. 

square.pro	Make a square region for plotting with the current device.

typeof.pro	Function to return the type of the variable---a shorthand
		for extracting the type from the array returned by size.
