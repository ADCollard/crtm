\section{Compilation}
%=====================
The compiler and compilation switches used for the two build systems are shown in table \ref{tab:lblrtm_compilation_switches}. Two executables were built: a single precision and a double precision version. For the latter build, compiler switches were used to promote the default floating point real and default integer types to double precision.

  \caption{Compilation switches for the two systems on which LNFL v2.5 and LBLRTM v11.3 were tested. $^\dagger$These switches were only used for the double precision build for LBLRTM.}
  \label{tab:lblrtm_compilation_switches}
\end{table}

Note that an earlier version of the IBM AIX compiler, v10.01.0000.0002, does not correctly compile LBLRTM in double precision mode. For the sake of other user's sanity, results for that particular compiler version for the double precision build are shown separately in appendix XXX. This is a known bug in the IBM compiler and a bug report was previously filed with IBM when the issue was discovered during LBLRTM v9.3 builds.
