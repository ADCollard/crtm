\section{Introduction}

Currently there are two separate atmospheric optics structures: \f{AtmAbsorption}, used to hold the gaseous absorption optical properties; and \f{AtmScatter}, used to hold the cloud and aerosol absorption and scattering optical properties. In the CRTM, these two structures are filled by their respective application modules, and are them combined into a spearate \f{AtmScatter} structure that is passed to the radiative transfer module. This document details the consolidation of these structures into a generic atmospheric optics structure.

The current definitions for the \f{AtmAbsorption} and \f{AtmScatter} structures are shown in figures \ref{fig:CRTM_AtmAbsorption_type_structure} and \ref{fig:CRTM_AtmScatter_type_structure} respectively. The simplicity of the \f{AtmAbsorption} structure definition will make the structure consolidation itself in the definition modules trivial as the only member of the \f{AtmAbsorption} structure already exist in name in the \f{AtmScatter} structure. The main issue is thus the combination of application modules in the various models (forward, tangent-linear, adjoint, and K-matrix.)

In the current CRTM, the \f{AtmAbsorption} structure is filled in the \f{CRTM\_Compute\_AtmAbsorption()} family of procedures and the \f{AtmScatter} structures for cloud and aerosol scattering, \f{CloudScatter} and \f{AerosolScatter} respectively, are filled in the \f{CRTM\_Compute\_CloudScatter()} and \f{CRTM\_Compute\_AerosolScatter()} family of procedures. A separate \f{AtmScatter} structure, named \f{AtmOptics}, is generated by combining the \f{AtmAbsorption}, \f{CloudScatter} and \f{AerosolScatter} structure components using the \f{CRTM\_Combine\_AtmOptics()} procedures. This \f{AtmOptics} structure is passed to the radiative transfer procedures.

The goal is to do the above with a generic \f{AtmOptics} structure, combining the various optical properties as required in the application modules themselves. This will simplify the source code as well as minimise the need for separate structure allocations.
