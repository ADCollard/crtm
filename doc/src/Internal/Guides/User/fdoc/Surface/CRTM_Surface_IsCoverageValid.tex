  NAME:
        CRTM_Surface_IsCoverageValid
 
  PURPOSE:
        Function to determine if the coverage fractions are valid
        for a CRTM Surface object. 
 
  CALLING SEQUENCE:
        result = CRTM_Surface_IsCoverageValid( Sfc )
 
  OBJECTS:
        Sfc:       CRTM Surface object which is to have its
                   coverage fractions checked.
                   UNITS:      N/A
                   TYPE:       CRTM_Surface_type
                   DIMENSION:  Scalar
                   ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN)
 
  FUNCTION RESULT:
        result:    Logical variable indicating whether or not the input
                   passed the check.
                   If == .FALSE., Surface object coverage fractions are invalid.
                      == .TRUE.,  Surface object coverage fractions are valid.
                   UNITS:      N/A
                   TYPE:       LOGICAL
                   DIMENSION:  Scalar
