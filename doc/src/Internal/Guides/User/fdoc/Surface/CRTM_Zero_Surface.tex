  NAME:
        CRTM_Zero_Surface
  
  PURPOSE:
        Subroutine to zero-out members of a CRTM Surface structure.
 
  CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CALL CRTM_Zero_Surface( Surface )
 
  OUTPUT ARGUMENTS:
        Surface:      Zeroed out Surface structure.
                      In the context of the CRTM, rank-1 corresponds to an
                      vector of profiles, and rank-2 corresponds to an array
                      of channels x profiles. The latter is used in the
                      K-matrix model.
                      UNITS:      N/A
                      TYPE:       CRTM_Surface_type
                      DIMENSION:  Scalar, Rank-1, or Rank-2 array
                      ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN OUT)
 
  COMMENTS:
        - No checking of the input structure is performed.
 
        - The SensorData dimension and structure components are *NOT*
          reset.
 
        - Note the INTENT on the output Surface argument is IN OUT rather than
          just OUT. This is necessary because the argument must be defined upon
          input.
