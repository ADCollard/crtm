                                this structure should be defined (e.g.
                                initialized to some value based on the
                                position of this function in the call chain.)

                                this structure should be defined (e.g.
                                initialized to some value based on the
                                position of this function in the call chain.)
                        UNITS:      N/A
                        TYPE:       CRTM_Surface_type
                        DIMENSION:  Same as input Atmosphere argument
                        ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN OUT)
 
        RTSolution:     Structure containing the solution to the RT equation
                        for the given inputs.
                        UNITS:      N/A
                        TYPE:       CRTM_RTSolution_type
                        DIMENSION:  Same as input RTSolution_AD argument
                        ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN OUT)
 
  FUNCTION RESULT:
        Error_Status:   The return value is an integer defining the error status.
                        The error codes are defined in the Message_Handler module.
                        If == SUCCESS the computation was sucessful
                           == FAILURE an unrecoverable error occurred
                        UNITS:      N/A
                        TYPE:       INTEGER
                        DIMENSION:  Scalar
 
  SIDE EFFECTS:
       Note that the input adjoint arguments are modified upon exit, and
       the output adjoint arguments must be defined upon entry. This is
       a consequence of the adjoint formulation where, effectively, the
       chain rule is being used and this function could reside anywhere
       in the chain of derivative terms.
 
  COMMENTS:
        - The Options optional structure arguments contain
          spectral information (e.g. emissivity) that must have the same
          spectral dimensionality (the "L" dimension) as the RTSolution
          structures.
