  NAME:
        CRTM_Associated_Atmosphere
 
  PURPOSE:
        Function to test the association status of the components of a
        CRTM Atmosphere structure.
 
  CALLING SEQUENCE:
        Association_Status = CRTM_Associated_Atmosphere( Atmosphere               , &
                                                         ANY_Test    =Any_Test    , &
                                                         Skip_Cloud  =Skip_Cloud  , &
                                                         Skip_Aerosol=Skip_Aerosol  )
 
  INPUT ARGUMENTS:
        Atmosphere:          Structure which is to have its pointer
                             member's association status tested.
                             UNITS:      N/A

                             ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN)
 
  OPTIONAL INPUT ARGUMENTS:
        ANY_Test:            Set this argument to test if ANY of the
                             Atmosphere structure components are associated.
                             The default is to test if ALL the components
                             are associated.
                             If ANY_Test = 0, test if ALL the components
                                              are associated.  (DEFAULT)
                                ANY_Test = 1, test if ANY of the components
                                              are associated.

        Skip_Cloud:          Set this argument to not include the Cloud
                             member in the association test. This is required
                             because a valid Atmosphere structure can be
                             cloud-free.
                             If Skip_Cloud = 0, the Cloud member association
                                                status is tested.  (DEFAULT)

                                                status is NOT tested.

        Skip_Aerosol:        Set this argument to not include the Aerosol
                             member in the association test. This is required
                             because a valid Atmosphere structure can be
                             aerosol-free.
                             If Skip_Aerosol = 0, the Aerosol member association
                                                  status is tested.  (DEFAULT)
                                Skip_Aerosol = 1, the Aerosol member association
                                                  status is NOT tested.

  FUNCTION RESULT:
        Association_Status:  The return value is a logical value indicating the
                             association status of the Atmosphere components.
                             .TRUE.  - if ALL the Atmosphere components are
                                       associated, or if the ANY_Test argument
                                       is set and ANY of the Atmosphere pointer
                                       members are associated.
                             .FALSE. - some or all of the Atmosphere pointer
                                       members are NOT associated.
