  NAME:
        CRTM_Zero_Cloud
  
  PURPOSE:
        Subroutine to zero-out various members of a CRTM Cloud structure - both
        scalar and pointer.
 
  CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CALL CRTM_Zero_Cloud( Cloud )
 
  OUTPUT ARGUMENTS:
        Cloud:        Zeroed out Cloud structure.
                      UNITS:      N/A
                      TYPE:       CRTM_Cloud_type
                      DIMENSION:  Scalar or Rank-1 array
                      ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN OUT)
 
  COMMENTS:
        - No checking of the input structure is performed, so there are no
          tests for pointer member association status. This means the Cloud
          structure must have allocated pointer members upon entry to this
          routine.
 
        - The dimension components of the structure are *NOT* set to zero.
 
        - The cloud type component is *NOT* reset.
 
        - Note the INTENT on the output Cloud argument is IN OUT rather than
          just OUT. This is necessary because the argument must be defined upon
          input.
