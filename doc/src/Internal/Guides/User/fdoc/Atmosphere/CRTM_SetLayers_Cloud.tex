  NAME:
        CRTM_SetLayers_Cloud
  
  PURPOSE:
        Function to set the number of layers to use in a CRTM Cloud
        structure.
 
  CALLING SEQUENCE:
        err_stat = CRTM_SetLayers_Cloud( n_Layers, &
                                         Cloud     )
 
  INPUTS:
        n_Layers:     The value to set the n_Layers component of the 
                      Cloud structure, as well as those of any of its
                      structure components.
                      UNITS:      N/A
                      TYPE:       CRTM_Cloud_type
                      DIMENSION:  Scalar
                      ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN)
 
        Cloud:        Cloud structure in which the n_Layers dimension
                      is to be updated.
                      UNITS:      N/A
                      TYPE:       CRTM_Cloud_type
                      DIMENSION:  Scalar OR Rank-1 array
                      ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN OUT)
  OUTPUTS:
        Cloud:        On output, the Cloud structure with the updated
                      n_Layers dimension.
                      UNITS:      N/A
                      TYPE:       CRTM_Cloud_type
                      DIMENSION:  Scalar or Rank-1 array
                      ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN OUT)
 
  FUNCTION RESULT:
        err_stat: The return value is an integer defining the error status.
                      The error codes are defined in the Message_Handler module.
                      If == SUCCESS the layer reset was successful
                         == FAILURE an error occurred
                      UNITS:      N/A
                      TYPE:       INTEGER
                      DIMENSION:  Scalar
 
  SIDE EFFECTS:
        The argument Cloud is INTENT(IN OUT) and is modified upon output. The
        elements of the structure are reinitialised
 
  COMMENTS:
        - Note that the n_Layers input is *ALWAYS* scalar. Thus, all Cloud
          elements will be set to the same number of layers.
 
        - If n_Layers <= Cloud%Max_Layers, then only the dimension value
          of the structure and any sub-structures are changed.
 
        - If n_Layers > Cloud%Max_Layers, then the entire structure is
          reallocated to the required number of layers.
