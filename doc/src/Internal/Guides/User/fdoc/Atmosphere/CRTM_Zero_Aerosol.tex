  NAME:
        CRTM_Zero_Aerosol
  
  PURPOSE:
        Subroutine to zero-out all members of a CRTM Aerosol structure - both
        scalar and pointer.
 
  CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CALL CRTM_Zero_Aerosol( Aerosol )
 
  OUTPUT ARGUMENTS:
        Aerosol: Zeroed out Aerosol structure.
                 UNITS:      N/A
                 TYPE:       CRTM_Aerosol_type
                 DIMENSION:  Scalar or Rank-1 array
                 ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN OUT)
 
  COMMENTS:
        - No checking of the input structure is performed, so there are no
          tests for pointer member association status. This means the Aerosol
          structure must have allocated pointer members upon entry to this
          routine.
 
        - The dimension components of the structure are *NOT*
          set to zero.
 
        - The aerosol type component is *NOT* reset.
 
        - Note the INTENT on the output Aerosol argument is IN OUT rather than
          just OUT. This is necessary because the argument must be defined upon
          input.
