  NAME:
        CRTM_Atmosphere_AddLayerCopy
  
  PURPOSE:
        Elemental function to copy an instance of the CRTM Atmosphere object
        with additional layers added to the TOA of the input.
 
  CALLING SEQUENCE:
        Atm_out = CRTM_Atmosphere_AddLayerCopy( Atm, n_Added_Layers )
 
  OBJECTS:
        Atm:             Atmosphere structure to copy.
                         UNITS:      N/A
                         TYPE:       CRTM_Atmosphere_type
                         DIMENSION:  Scalar or any rank
                         ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(OUT)
 
  INPUTS:
        n_Added_Layers:  Number of layers to add to the function result.
                         UNITS:      N/A
                         TYPE:       INTEGER
                         DIMENSION:  Same as atmosphere object
                         ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN)
 
  FUNCTION RESULT:
        Atm_out:         Copy of the input atmosphere structure with space for
                         extra layers added to TOA.
                         UNITS:      N/A
                         TYPE:       CRTM_Atmosphere_type
                         DIMENSION:  Same as input.
                         ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(OUT)
