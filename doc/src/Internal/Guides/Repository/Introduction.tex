\chapter{Introduction}
%=====================
This document describes the CRTM subversion repository and how to set up your environment to allow you to build the CRTM library, and any associated programs, directly in your working copy. It is assumed the user is familiar with Subversion.

The CRTM is one of many projects in main EMC repository on the subversion server \texttt{svn.ncep.noaa.gov}. The location of the CRTM project repository is \f{https://svn.ncep.noaa.gov/emc/crtm}. Note that, as of November 2008, the EMC repository is still behind the NCEP firewalls and access is available only to users on the NCEP network, or via a VPN connection into the NCEP network.

A read-only mirror of the EMC repository is available on the vapor supercomputer. The location of the CRTM repository mirror on vapor is \f{file:///gpfs/v/svn/emc/crtm}. This mirror is automatically updated from the subversion server every night so users should be aware that any changes to the repository will not be available on vapor until the next day.
