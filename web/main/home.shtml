<p>The Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) under development at the
<a href="http://www.jcsda.noaa.gov">Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation (JCSDA)</a>
is an important component in the NOAA/NCEP data analysis system. External research
groups funded by JCSDA have also been making their contributions to its development.
In order to help the developers to understand the requirements from the analysis system
and to reduce the inconsistencies among the components developed by various groups, this
web page will serve as an online source for information about the software framework for
the development of the CRTM.

<p>The main goal of this CRTM framework is to provide developers, and users, with the
information, examples, and utilities necessary to produce software that is flexible (in
both development and usage), understandable, and easily maintained.

<p>The CRTM framework breaks the radiative transfer model into components (e.g. gaseous
absorption, scattering, surface optics); each of which defines its own data structure and
algorithm modules to faciliate independent development of each component. This characterisation
is obviously an ideal one since there are dependencies -- in terms of both the physical
problem being solved and in software details such as data sharing -- that will not allow
every component to be developed in isolation from the others. So, this is not intended to
be a replacement for necessary dialogue between developers, but to provide some form of
"big picture" for all those involved to minimise or eliminate potential software conflicts
and/or redundencies.

<p>Due to the complexity of the radiative transfer problem and the difficulty of balancing
the code efficiency and flexibility, we fully anticipate problems arising when the framework
is applied in the development process. We sincerely welcome

<!-- ===================================== -->
<h2><a name="CONVENTIONS"></a>Conventions</h2>
<!-- ===================================== -->

The following are conventions that have been adhered to in the current release of the 
CRTM framework. Please note that they are guidelines intended to make understanding the
code at a glance easier, to provide a recognisable "look and feel", and to minimise name
space clashes. They are not intended to be requirements imposed from on-high onto developers.


<h3><a name="TYPE_CONVENTIONS"></a>Naming of Structure Types and Instances of Structure</h3>
<!-- =================================================================================== -->

The structure type naming convention adopted for use in the CRTM is,
<br><br>
<span class="indent1">[<tt>CRTM_</tt>]<em>&lt;name&gt;</em><tt>_type</tt></span>
<br><br>
where <em>&lt;name&gt;</em> is some sort of identifier that indicates for what a
structure is to be used. <em>All</em> structure type names are suffixed with
"<tt>_type</tt>" and CRTM-specific structure types are prefixed with "<tt>CRTM_</tt>".
Some examples,

<pre>
  SpcCoeff_type
  CRTM_Atmosphere_type
  CRTM_AtmScatter_type
</pre>

<p>An instance of a structure is then referred to via its <em>&lt;name&gt;</em>, or some
sort of derivate of its <em>&lt;name&gt;</em>. Some structure declarations examples are then,

<pre>
  TYPE( SpcCoeff_type )        :: SpcCoeff
  TYPE( CRTM_Atmosphere_type ) :: Atmosphere, Atmosphere_AD
  TYPE( CRTM_AtmScatter_type ) :: AtmScatter, AtmScatter_AD
</pre>

<p>where the adjoint structure variables are identified with an "<tt>_AD</tt>" suffix.


<h3><a name="DEFN_CONVENTIONS"></a>Naming of Definition Modules</h3>
<!-- =========================================================== -->

Modules containing structure type definitions are termed <em>definition modules</em>. The naming
convention adopted for definition modules in the CRTM is,
<br><br>
<span class="indent1">[<tt>CRTM_</tt>]<em>&lt;name&gt;</em><tt>_Define</tt></span>
<br><br>
where, as with the structure type names, <em>all</em> definition module names are suffixed
with "<tt>_Define</tt>" and CRTM-specific definition modules are prefixed with "<tt>CRTM_</tt>".
Some examples,

<pre>
  SpcCoeff_Define
  CRTM_Atmosphere_Define
  CRTM_AtmAbsorption_Define
  CRTM_AtmScatter_Define
</pre>

<p>The actual source code files for these modules have the same name with an "<tt>.f90</tt>" suffix.


<h3><a name="APPL_CONVENTIONS"></a>Naming of Application Modules</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Modules containing the routines that perform the calculations for the various components of the
CRTM are termed <em>application modules</em>. The naming convention adopted for application
modules in the CRTM is,
<br><br>
<span class="indent1"><tt>CRTM_</tt><em>&lt;name&gt;</em></span>
<br><br>
Some examples,

<pre>
  CRTM_AtmAbsorption
  CRTM_SfcOptics
</pre>

<p>An exception to this convention is for the scattering application code. Separate modules
have been provided to contain the aerosol and cloud absorption/scattering code,

<pre>
  CRTM_AerosolScatter
  CRTM_CloudScatter
</pre>

<p>Both of these modules use the <tt>AtmScatter</tt> structure definitions. For more details, see
the <a href="../crtm/CRTM_Developer_Interface.html#ATMSCATTER">AtmScatter section in the Developer's Interface.</a>

<p>Again, the actual source code files for these modules have the same name with an "<tt>.f90</tt>"
suffix. Note that not all definition modules have a corresponding application module since some
structures (e.g. <tt>SpcCoeff</tt> and <tt>Atmosphere</tt> structures) are simply data containers.
