* all pages can be implemented via a Dreamweaver (DW) Template that
  can be dowloaded from 
  http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/Templates/crtm.dwt
  (/var/apache/cimss/htdocs/Templates/crtm.dwt)
  This template defines editable regions using specially formatted
  HTML comments that DW understands (browsers and other HTML editors
  will ignore these since they are HTML comments)

* all pages created using the DW template should have the following
  file extension: .shtml (or .shtm)
  This allows the server-side-include HTML comment/tag 
  for the main navigation links across the top
     <!--#include virtual="/main/ssi/mainnav.ssi.html"-->
  and the secondary navigation links on the left 
     <!--#include virtual="/main/ssi/link_a.ssi.html"-->
  to work (this basically tells the Apache web server to grab the contents
  of the specified file and put them where the comment/tag was)
 
* The secondary navigation links on the left are defined in ssi files in the folder
  http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/crtm/ssi/
  (/var/apache/cimss/htdocs/crtm/ssi/)
  and use the following naming convention:
     categoryID.ssi.html
  where categoryID corresponds to the id="categoryID" in 
  http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/crtm/ssi/mainnav.ssi.html
  (/var/apache/cimss/htdocs/crtm/ssi/mainnav.ssi.html)
  
* To denote the current category, in the "content" DW editable region,
  there should be a hidden form field 
      <input type="hidden" name="category" id="category" value="link_c">
  where value should always be equal to the relevant categoryID.  
  The javascript.js linked to will use this to determine which main category
  link to assign the class="current_category" attribute.  This CSS class
  is in turn defined in the style.css (i.e., you can change the formatting
  of the current category link at the top by modifying the 
    .current_category {}
  lines in style.css)
  
  
* formatting of the pages is done via 
  http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/crtm/style.css
  (/var/apache/cimss/htdocs/crtm/style.css)
  and style.ie.css to add some fixes for IE
