<hr width="100%">

<p>This section describes the various shared data structure types that are loaded 
with precomputed data during the CRTM initialization phase. They are <em>not</em>
visible via the CRTM user interface.

<p>Both the shared data structures and their I/O routines will need to be modified to
accomodate the various group's algorithms that will be used in the CRTM. Different 
approaches will require different datafiles to be read in.

<h2><a name="SPCCOEFF_DATA"></a><tt>SpcCoeff</tt> Data</h2>
<!-- ================================================== -->

The <tt>SpcCoeff</tt> data is used to make instrument specific spectral data available 
within the CRTM. The structure definition and the data itself is not specific to the 
CRTM. More information about the structure definition, data files and utilities can be
found on the
<a href="http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/~paulv/Fortran90/Instrument_Information/SpcCoeff" target="_blank">main SpcCoeff page</a>.



<h3><a name="CRTM_SPCCOEFF"></a>The <tt>CRTM_SpcCoeff</tt> Module</h3>
<!-- ============================================================= -->

<p>For use in the CRTM, the initialization phase loads the <tt>SpcCoeff</tt> data into a public
data structure that resides in the
<tt><a href="Coefficients/Modules.html#CRTM_SPCCOEFF">CRTM_SpcCoeff</a></tt>
module. To gain access to the <tt>SpcCoeff</tt> data, one simply uses it in their CRTM
application module,

<pre>
  USE <a href="Coefficients/Modules.html#CRTM_SPCCOEFF">CRTM_SpcCoeff</a>
</pre>

<p>In the 
<tt><a href="Coefficients/Modules.html#CRTM_SPCCOEFF">CRTM_SpcCoeff</a></tt>
module, the <tt>SpcCoeff</tt> data structure is declared as a publicly visible,

<pre>
  TYPE( SpcCoeff_type ), SAVE, PUBLIC :: SC
</pre>

<p>so once the module is <tt>USE</tt>d, the application module can access all the
<tt>SC</tt> structure contents loaded during initialization.





<!-- ================================================== -->
<h2><a name="TAUCOEFF_DATA"></a><tt>TauCoeff</tt> Data</h2>
<!-- ================================================== -->

The <tt>TauCoeff</tt> data is used in the
<a href="CRTM_Developer_Interface.html#ATMABSORPTION_APPLICATION">AtmAbsorption application code</a>
to compute optical depths due to gaseous absorption. Currently, the <tt>TauCoeff</tt> data
is crafted for the Compact OPTRAN algorithm, but future changes to the <tt>TauCoeff</tt> 
structure definition and datafile I/O functions are planned to prepare the CRTM to use
the OPTRAN v7 and the OSS algorithms for testing and comparison. As such, the <tt>TauCoeff</tt>
structure definition and datafile formats are considered <em>specific to the AtmAbsorption algorithm
used in the CRTM</em>. It is expected that various groups will alter the structure definition
and I/O functions accordingly. More information about the current structure definition, data
files and utilities can be found on the
<a href="http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/~paulv/Fortran90/CRTM/Coefficients/TauCoeff" target="_blank">main TauCoeff page</a>.



<h3><a name="CRTM_TAUCOEFF"></a>The <tt>CRTM_TauCoeff</tt> Module</h3>
<!-- ============================================================= -->

<p>For use in the CRTM, the initialization phase loads the <tt>TauCoeff</tt> data into a public
data structure that resides in the
<tt><a href="Coefficients/Modules.html#CRTM_TAUCOEFF">CRTM_TauCoeff</a></tt>
module. To gain access to the <tt>TauCoeff</tt> data, the following,

<pre>
  USE <a href="Coefficients/Modules.html#CRTM_TAUCOEFF">CRTM_TauCoeff</a>
</pre>

<p>is required in the <a href="AtmAbsorption/Modules.html#CRTM_ATMABSORPTION">AtmAbsorption application module</a>.

<p>In the 
<tt><a href="Coefficients/Modules.html#CRTM_TAUCOEFF">CRTM_TauCoeff</a></tt>
module, the <tt>TauCoeff</tt> data structure is declared as publicly visible,

<pre>
  TYPE( TauCoeff_type ), SAVE, PUBLIC :: TC
</pre>

<p>so once the module is <tt>USE</tt>d, the application module can access all the
<tt>TC</tt> structure contents loaded during initialization.



<h3><a name="TAUCOEFF_MODIFICATION"></a><tt>TauCoeff</tt> Structure and I/O Function Modifications</h3>
<!-- ============================================================================================== -->

<p>In preparing the CRTM to use a different AtmAbsorption algorithm, the <tt>TauCoeff</tt>
structure definition and manipulation routines (in the
<tt><a href="Coefficients/TauCoeff/TauCoeff_Define.f90.html">TauCoeff_Define</a></tt>
module) and the data file I/O functions (in the 
<tt><a href="Coefficients/TauCoeff/TauCoeff_Binary_IO.f90.html">TauCoeff_Binary_IO</a></tt>
module) will all need to be modified.

<p>Note that all of these <tt>TauCoeff</tt> modules are considered effectively separate from
the CRTM. Of course, there is still a dependency since the
<tt><a href="Coefficients/TauCoeff/TauCoeff_Binary_IO.f90.html">TauCoeff_Binary_IO</a></tt>
functions are called from within the
<tt><a href="Coefficients/Modules.html#CRTM_TAUCOEFF">CRTM_TauCoeff</a></tt>
