       *!IMPORTANT!*
       -------------
       Note that the CRTM_Atmosphere_type is PUBLIC and its members are
       not encapsulated; that is, they can be fully accessed outside the
       scope of this module. This makes it possible to manipulate
       the structure and its data directly rather than, for e.g., via
       get() and set() functions. This was done to eliminate the
       overhead of the get/set type of structure access in using the
       structure. *But*, it is recommended that the user destroy,
       allocate, assign, and concatenate the structure using only the
       routines in this module where possible to eliminate -- or at
       least minimise -- the possibility of memory leakage since most
       of the structure members are pointers.

         4) The parameter array
              H2O_ONLY_UNITS_FLAG
            contains a list of flags for each absorber units type that idenitifies
            it as being valid for *all* absorbers (0) or valid for water vapour
            only (1). For example the values of
              H2O_ONLY_UNITS_FLAG( RELATIVE_HUMIDITY_UNITS )
            and
              H2O_ONLY_UNITS_FLAG( SPECIFIC_AMOUNT_UNITS )
            are 1 and 0 respectively indicating that the former is a valid unit for
            water vapour ONLY but the latter can be used for any absorber.

       *!IMPORTANT!*
       -------------
       Note that the CRTM_Cloud_type is PUBLIC and its members are not
       encapsulated; that is, they can be fully accessed outside the
       scope of this module. This makes it possible to manipulate
       the structure and its data directly rather than, for e.g., via
       get() and set() functions. This was done to eliminate the
       overhead of the get/set type of structure access in using the
       structure. *But*, it is recommended that the user destroy,
       allocate, assign, and concatenate the structure using only the
       routines in this module where possible to eliminate -- or at
       least minimise -- the possibility of memory leakage since most
       of the structure members are pointers.

          parameter.

       3) The character string array parameter
            CLOUD_TYPE_NAME

       --------------------
         Definition of the CRTM scattering data structure.
         Fields are:

         n_Layers:                Number of atmospheric layers.

                                  size distribution modes. The effective radius is

                                  distribution to the second moment.

       *!IMPORTANT!*
       -------------
       Note that the CRTM_Aerosol_type is PUBLIC and its members are
       not encapsulated; that is, they can be fully accessed outside the
       scope of this module. This makes it possible to manipulate
       the structure and its data directly rather than, for e.g., via
       get() and set() functions. This was done to eliminate the
       overhead of the get/set type of structure access in using the
       structure. *But*, it is recommended that the user destroy,
       allocate, assign, and concatenate the structure using only
       the routines in this module where possible to eliminate -- or
       at least minimise -- the possibility of memory leakage since
       most of the structure members are pointers.

 PUBLIC PARAMETERS:
       1) The valid aerosol type values used in the Aerosol%Type field:

              Aerosol Type      Parameter Name

                Sulfate         SULFATE_AEROSOL  

       2) The number of valid aerosol types is specified by the 
            N_VALID_AEROSOL_TYPES
          parameter.

       3) The character string array parameter
            AEROSOL_TYPE_NAME
          uses the above aerosol type definitions to provide a string value for
          the type of aerosol. For example,
            AEROSOL_TYPE_NAME( DRY_BLACK_CARBON_AEROSOL )
          contains the string
            'Dry black carbon'
