       *!IMPORTANT!*
       -------------
       Note that the TauCoeff_type is PUBLIC and its members are not
       encapsulated; that is, they can be fully accessed outside the
       scope of this module. This makes it possible to manipulate
       the structure and its data directly rather than, for e.g., via
       get() and set() functions. This was done to eliminate the
       overhead of the get/set type of structure access in using the
       structure. *But*, it is recommended that the user initialize,
       destroy, allocate, assign, and concatenate the structure
       using only the routines in this module where possible to
       eliminate -- or at least minimise -- the possibility of 
       memory leakage since most of the structure members are
       pointers.
