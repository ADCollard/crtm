 DERIVED TYPES:
       CRTM_RTSolution_type
       --------------------
         Definition of the CRTM radiative transfer solution data
         structure. Fields are,

         n_Stokes:                Number of Stokes parameters used to
                                  represent the propagating radiation.
                                  This is the &quot;Ls&quot; dimension
                                  UNITS:      N/A
                                  TYPE:       INTEGER
                                  DIMENSION:  Scalar

         Radiance:                The top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative
                                  transfer result in radiance units.
                                  ** NOTE: THIS IS A MANDATORY MEMBER **
                                  **       OF THIS STRUCTURE          **
                                  UNITS:      mW/(m2.sr.cm-1)
                                  TYPE:       REAL( fp_kind )
                                  DIMENSION:  Rank-1 (Ls)

         Brightness_Temperature:  The top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative
                                  transfer result in temperature units.
                                  ** NOTE: THIS IS A MANDATORY MEMBER **
                                  **       OF THIS STRUCTURE          **
                                  UNITS:      Kelvin
                                  TYPE:       REAL( fp_kind )
                                  DIMENSION:  Rank-1 (Ls)

       *!IMPORTANT!*
       -------------
       Note that the CRTM_RTSolution_type is PUBLIC and its members are
       not encapsulated; that is, they can be fully accessed outside the
       scope of this module. This makes it possible to manipulate
       the structure and its data directly rather than, for e.g., via
       get() and set() functions. This was done to eliminate the
       overhead of the get/set type of structure access in using the
       structure. *But*, it is recommended that the user destroy,
       allocate, and assign the structure using only the routines
       in this module where possible to eliminate -- or at least
       minimise -- the possibility of memory leakage since most
       of the structure members are pointers.
