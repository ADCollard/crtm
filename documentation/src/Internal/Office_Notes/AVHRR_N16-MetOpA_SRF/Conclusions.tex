\section{Conclusions}
%====================
This quick look at the AVHRR infrared channel SRFs can be summarised as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Despite their radiometric similarity, we need to reconcile the differences between the two sets of NOAA-17 SRFs to determine which is representative of the actual instrument,
  \item The radiometric differences between the SRFs used to generate the current CRTM SpcCoeff and TauCoeff data and the official interpolated SRF are minimal, and
  \item Given any sufficiently well defined SRF, the method of interpolation used to put the SRF on a regular frequency grid has minimal radiometric impact.
  \item Visual inspection of the SRF data is crucial to ensure that any measurement anomalies do not propagate into the final processed SRF.
\end{itemize}
