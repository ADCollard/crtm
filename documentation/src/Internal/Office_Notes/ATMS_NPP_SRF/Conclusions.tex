\section{Conclusions}
%====================
Four different ATMS SRFs were used in this study: a simple boxcar SRF derived using the passband widths and frequency offsets; digitised data taken from the ATMS PFM Calibration Data Book\cite{ATMS_PFM_CalLog}, the ``Table 12'' SRFs; digistisations of selected channels from reference \cite{ATMS_PFM_CalLog} performed at SDL, the ``SDL'' SRFs; and digistisations of selected channels from reference \cite{ATMS_PFM_CalLog} performed at NGAS, the ``NGAS'' SRFs.

The degree to which the differences in the SRFs is reflected in the radiative transfer results of section \ref{sec:rt} varies with the channel with no clear pattern.

Comparison of the common SDL and NGAS SRFs indicate that the digitisation process used is not a factor, although the quality of the figures from reference \cite{ATMS_PFM_CalLog} that were used are a factor, as pointed out by both C.L. Chidester and G. DeAmici when they encountered non-orthogonal axes in the scanned figures.

While additional measurements of the NPP ATMS channel responses may no longer be possible, what should be required for future NPOESS ATMS instruments (indeed, \textsl{any} future microwave instrument) is the original digital data of the measured channel responses. This can only serve to mitigate lack of knowledge of the channel spectral response functions as a source of error in the on-orbit measured radiances.
