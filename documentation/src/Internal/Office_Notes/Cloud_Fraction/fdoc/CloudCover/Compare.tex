  NAME:
    .Compare.
 
  PURPOSE:
    Operator method to compare two CloudCover objects.
 
    This procedure performs similarly to the == operator, but is non-elemental
    to allow for informational output when a difference is found between the
    two objects being compared.
 
    Mostly used for debugging.
 
  CALLING SEQUENCE:
    IF ( x .Compare. y ) THEN
      ...
    END IF
 
  OBJECTS:
    x, y:      The cloud cover objects to compare.
               UNITS:      N/A
               CLASS:      CRTM_CloudCover_type
               DIMENSION:  Scalar
               ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN)
