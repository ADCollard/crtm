  NAME:
    Overlap_Id
 
  PURPOSE:
    Function method to return the overlap methodology identifier of a
    CloudCover object.
 
  CALLING SEQUENCE:
    id = cc_obj%Overlap_Id()
 
  OBJECTS:
    cc_obj:  Cloud cover object for which the overlap methodology identifier
             is required.
             UNITS:      N/A
             CLASS:      CRTM_CloudCover_type
             DIMENSION:  Scalar
             ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(OUT)
 
  FUNCTION RESULT:
    id:      The return value is an integer defining the overlap methodology.
             The actual number value of these integers in a CRTM release can
             change at any time based upon code updates.
             UNITS:      N/A
             TYPE:       INTEGER
             DIMENSION:  Scalar
