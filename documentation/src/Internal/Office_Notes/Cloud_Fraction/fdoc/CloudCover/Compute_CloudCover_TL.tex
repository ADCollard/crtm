  NAME:
    Compute_CloudCover_TL
 
  PURPOSE:
    Function method to compute the tangent-linear cloud cover profile for
    supplied forward model results and a Atmosphere perturbation, and populate
    the tangent-linear CloudCover object with the results.
 
  CALLING SEQUENCE:
    err_stat = cc_obj_TL%Compute_CloudCover_TL( &
                 cc_FWD       , &
                 atmosphere_TL  )
 
  OBJECTS:
    cc_obj_TL:      The tangent-linear cloud cover object which is to be
                    populated with perturbed cloud cover results.
                    UNITS:      N/A
                    CLASS:      CRTM_CloudCover_type
                    DIMENSION:  Scalar
                    ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(OUT)
 
  INPUTS:
    cc_FWD:         The forward model cloud cover object.
                    UNITS:      N/A
                    CLASS:      CRTM_CloudCover_type
                    DIMENSION:  Scalar
                    ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN)
 
    atmosphere_TL:  The tangent-linear atmosphere object containing the layer
                    cloud fraction perturbation profile, and the cloud amount
                    perturbation profiles for when cloud water content averaging
                    of the cloud cover is selected.
                    UNITS:      N/A
                    TYPE:       CRTM_Atmosphere_type
                    DIMENSION:  Scalar
                    ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN)
 
  FUNCTION RESULT:
    err_stat:       The return value is an integer defining the error status.
                    The error codes are defined in the Message_Handler module.
                      If == SUCCESS, the computation was successful
                         == FAILURE, an unrecoverable error occurred.
                    UNITS:      N/A
                    TYPE:       INTEGER
                    DIMENSION:  Scalar
