  NAME:
    Compute_CloudCover_AD
 
  PURPOSE:
    Function method to compute the adjoint cloud cover profile for supplied
    forward model results and populate the Atmosphere adjoint object
    with the results.
 
  CALLING SEQUENCE:
    err_stat = cc_obj_AD%Compute_CloudCover_AD( &
                 cc_FWD       , &
                 atmosphere_AD  )
 
  OBJECTS:
    cc_obj_AD:      The adjoint cloud cover object. This object contains
                    data on input, but is zeroed out upon output.
                    UNITS:      N/A
                    CLASS:      CRTM_CloudCover_type
                    DIMENSION:  Scalar
                    ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN OUT)
 
  INPUTS:
    cc_FWD:         The forward model cloud cover object.
                    UNITS:      N/A
                    CLASS:      CRTM_CloudCover_type
                    DIMENSION:  Scalar
                    ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN)
 
  OUTPUTS:
    atmosphere_AD:  The adjoint atmosphere object containing the results of the
                    adjoint calculation. The adjoint cloud fraction profile
                    will be modified on output. For the weighted average cloud
                    clover method, the adjoint cloud water amounts will also be
                    modified.
                    UNITS:      N/A
                    TYPE:       CRTM_Atmosphere_type
                    DIMENSION:  Scalar
                    ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN OUT)
 
  FUNCTION RESULT:
    err_stat:       The return value is an integer defining the error status.
                    The error codes are defined in the Message_Handler module.
                      If == SUCCESS, the computation was successful
                         == FAILURE, an unrecoverable error occurred.
                    UNITS:      N/A
                    TYPE:       INTEGER
                    DIMENSION:  Scalar
