  NAME:
        CRTM_Cloud_Zero
 
  PURPOSE:
        Elemental subroutine to zero out the data arrays in a CRTM Cloud object.
 
  CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CALL CRTM_Cloud_Zero( Cloud )
 
  OBJECTS:
        Cloud:         CRTM Cloud structure in which the data arrays are
                       to be zeroed out.
                       UNITS:      N/A
                       TYPE:       CRTM_Cloud_type
                       DIMENSION:  Scalar or any rank
                       ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN OUT)
 
  COMMENTS:
        - The dimension components of the structure are *NOT* set to zero.
        - The cloud type component is *NOT* reset.
