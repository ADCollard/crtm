  NAME:
        CRTM_Atmosphere_SetLayers
 
  PURPOSE:
        Elemental subroutine to set the working number of layers to use
        in a CRTM Atmosphere object.
 
  CALLING SEQUENCE:
       CALL CRTM_Atmosphere_SetLayers( Atmosphere, n_Layers )
 
  OBJECT:
        Atmosphere:   CRTM Atmosphere object which is to have its working number
                      of layers updated.
                      UNITS:      N/A
                      TYPE:       CRTM_Atmosphere_type
                      DIMENSION:  Scalar or any rank
                      ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN OUT)
 
  INPUTS:
        n_Layers:     The value to set the n_Layers component of the
                      Atmosphere object.
                      UNITS:      N/A
                      TYPE:       CRTM_Atmosphere_type
                      DIMENSION:  Conformable with the Atmosphere object argument
                      ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN)
 
  COMMENTS:
        - The object is zeroed upon output.
 
        - If n_Layers <= Atmosphere%Max_Layers, then only the n_Layers dimension
          value of the object, as well as any contained objects, is changed.
 
        - If n_Layers > Atmosphere%Max_Layers, then the object is reallocated
          to the required number of layers. No other dimensions of the object
          or contained objects are altered.
