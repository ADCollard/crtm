  NAME:
        CRTM_Cloud_SetLayers
 
  PURPOSE:
        Elemental subroutine to set the working number of layers to use
        in a CRTM Cloud object.
 
  CALLING SEQUENCE:
       CALL CRTM_Cloud_SetLayers( Cloud, n_Layers )
 
  OBJECT:
        Cloud:        CRTM Cloud object which is to have its working number
                      of layers updated.
                      UNITS:      N/A
                      TYPE:       CRTM_Cloud_type
                      DIMENSION:  Scalar or any rank
                      ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN OUT)
 
  INPUTS:
        n_Layers:     The value to set the n_Layers component of the
                      Cloud object.
                      UNITS:      N/A
                      TYPE:       CRTM_Cloud_type
                      DIMENSION:  Conformable with the Cloud object argument
                      ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN)
 
  COMMENTS:
        - The object is zeroed upon output.
 
        - If n_Layers <= Cloud%Max_Layers, then only the dimension value
          of the object is changed.
 
        - If n_Layers > Cloud%Max_Layers, then the object is reallocated
          to the required number of layers.
