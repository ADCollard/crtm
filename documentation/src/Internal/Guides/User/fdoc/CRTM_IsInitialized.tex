  NAME:
        CRTM_IsInitialized
 
  PURPOSE:
        Logical function to test if the CRTM has been correctly initialized.
 
  CALLING SEQUENCE:
        status = CRTM_IsInitialized( ChannelInfo )
 
  INPUTS:
        ChannelInfo:  ChannelInfo structure array.
                      UNITS:      N/A
                      TYPE:       CRTM_ChannelInfo_type
                      DIMENSION:  Rank-1
                      ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN)
 
  FUNCTION RESULT:
        Status:       The return value is a logical result indicating if the
                      CRTM has been correctly initialised.
                      If == .TRUE., all the ChannelInfo entries are valid.
                         == .FALSE., any of the ChannelInfo entries are invalid.
                      UNITS:      N/A
                      TYPE:       LOGICAL
                      DIMENSION:  Scalar
