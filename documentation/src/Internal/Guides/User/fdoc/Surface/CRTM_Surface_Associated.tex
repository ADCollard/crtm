  NAME:
        CRTM_Surface_Associated
 
  PURPOSE:
        Elemental function to test the status of the allocatable components
        of a CRTM Surface object.
 
  CALLING SEQUENCE:
        Status = CRTM_Surface_Associated( Sfc )
 
  OBJECTS:
        Sfc:       Surface structure which is to have its member's
                   status tested.
                   UNITS:      N/A
                   TYPE:       CRTM_Surface_type
                   DIMENSION:  Scalar or any rank
                   ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN)
 
  FUNCTION RESULT:
        Status:    The return value is a logical value indicating the
                   status of the Surface members.
                     .TRUE.  - if the array components are allocated.
                     .FALSE. - if the array components are not allocated.
                   UNITS:      N/A
                   TYPE:       LOGICAL
                   DIMENSION:  Same as input
