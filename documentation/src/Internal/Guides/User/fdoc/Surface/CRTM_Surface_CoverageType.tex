  NAME:
        CRTM_Surface_CoverageType
 
  PURPOSE:
        Elemental function to return the gross surface type based on coverage.
 
  CALLING SEQUENCE:
        type = CRTM_Surface_CoverageType( sfc )
 
  INPUTS:
        Sfc:  CRTM Surface object for which the gross surface type is required.
              UNITS:      N/A
              TYPE:       CRTM_Surface_type
              DIMENSION:  Scalar or any rank
              ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN)
 
  FUNCTION:
        type: Surface type indicator for the passed CRTM Surface object.
              UNITS:      N/A
              TYPE:       INTEGER
              DIMENSION:  Same as input
 
  COMMENTS:
        For a scalar Surface object, this function result can be used to
        determine what gross surface types are included by using it to
        index the SURFACE_TYPE_NAME parameter arrays, e.g.
 
          WRITE(*,*) SURFACE_TYPE_NAME(CRTM_Surface_CoverageType(sfc))
