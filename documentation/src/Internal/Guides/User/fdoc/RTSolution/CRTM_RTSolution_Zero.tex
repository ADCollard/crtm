  NAME:
        CRTM_RTSolution_Zero
 
  PURPOSE:
        Elemental subroutine to zero out the data components
        in a CRTM RTSolution object.
 
  CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CALL CRTM_RTSolution_Zero( rts )
 
  OUTPUTS:
        rts:          CRTM RTSolution structure in which the data components
                      are to be zeroed out.
                      UNITS:      N/A
                      TYPE:       CRTM_RTSolution_type
                      DIMENSION:  Scalar or any rank
                      ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN OUT)
 
  COMMENTS:
        - The dimension components of the structure are *NOT* set to zero.
        - The sensor infomration and RT algorithm components are
          *NOT* reset in this routine.
