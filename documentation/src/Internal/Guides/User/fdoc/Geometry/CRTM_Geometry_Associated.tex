  NAME:
        CRTM_Geometry_Associated
 
  PURPOSE:
        Elemental function to test the status of the allocatable components
        of a CRTM Geometry object.
 
  CALLING SEQUENCE:
        Status = CRTM_Geometry_Associated( geo )
 
  OBJECTS:
        geo:          Geometry structure which is to have its member's
                      status tested.
                      UNITS:      N/A
                      TYPE:       CRTM_Geometry_type
                      DIMENSION:  Scalar or any rank
                      ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN)
 
  FUNCTION RESULT:
        Status:       The return value is a logical value indicating the
                      status of the Geometry members.
                        .TRUE.  - if the array components are allocated.
                        .FALSE. - if the array components are not allocated.
                      UNITS:      N/A
                      TYPE:       LOGICAL
                      DIMENSION:  Same as input Geometry argument
