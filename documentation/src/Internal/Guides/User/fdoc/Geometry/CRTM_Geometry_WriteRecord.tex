  NAME:
        CRTM_Geometry_WriteRecord
 
  PURPOSE:
        Function to write a single Geometry data record
 
  CALLING SEQUENCE:
        Error_Status = CRTM_Geometry_WriteRecord( FileID, Geometry )
 
  INPUTS:
        FileID:       Logical unit number to which data is written
                      UNITS:      N/A
                      TYPE:       INTEGER
                      DIMENSION:  Scalar
                      ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN)
 
        Geometry:     CRTM Geometry object containing the data to write.
                      UNITS:      N/A
                      TYPE:       CRTM_Geometry_type
                      DIMENSION:  Scalar
                      ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN)
 
  FUNCTION RESULT:
        Error_Status: The return value is an integer defining the error status.
                      The error codes are defined in the Message_Handler module.
                      If == SUCCESS the record write was successful
                         == FAILURE an unrecoverable error occurred.
                      UNITS:      N/A
                      TYPE:       INTEGER
                      DIMENSION:  Scalar
