  NAME:
        LBLRTM_File_Open
 
  PURPOSE:
        Function to open an LBLRTM format data file. If the file is opened for
        reading, then a check is performed to determine if the file is of the
        right byte-sex.
 
  CALLING SEQUENCE:
        Error_Status = LBLRTM_File_Open( &
                         Filename, &
                         FileId  , &
                         For_Output = For_Output, &
                         Quiet      = Quiet       )
 
  INPUTS:
        FileName:      The LBLRTM formay datafile to open.
                       UNITS:      N/A
                       TYPE:       INTEGER
                       DIMENSION:  Scalar
                       ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN)
 
  OUTPUTS:
        FileId:        The unit number for file access.
                       UNITS:      N/A
                       TYPE:       INTEGER
                       DIMENSION:  Scalar
                       ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN)
 
  OPTIONAL INPUTS:
        For_Output:    Set this logical argument to open a new file for
                       writing. Default action is to open an existing file
                       for read access.
                       If == .FALSE., existing file is opened for READ access [DEFAULT]
                                      ACTION='READ', STATUS='OLD'
                          == .TRUE. , new file is opened for WRITE access.
                                      ACTION='WRITE', STATUS='REPLACE'
                       If not specified, the default is .FALSE.
                       NOTE: If the file already exists and it is opened with
                             this keyword set to .TRUE., the file is OVERWRITTEN.
                       UNITS:      N/A
                       TYPE:       LOGICAL
                       DIMENSION:  Scalar
                       ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN), OPTIONAL
 
        Quiet:         Set this logical argument to suppress INFORMATION
                       messages being printed to stdout
                       If == .FALSE., INFORMATION messages are OUTPUT [DEFAULT].
                          == .TRUE.,  INFORMATION messages are SUPPRESSED.
                       If not specified, default is .FALSE.
                       UNITS:      N/A
                       TYPE:       LOGICAL
                       DIMENSION:  Scalar
                       ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN), OPTIONAL
 
  FUNCTION RESULT:
        Error_Status: The return value is an integer defining the error status.
                      The error codes are defined in the Message_Handler module.
                      If == SUCCESS the LBLRTM file open was successful
                         == FAILURE an unrecoverable error occurred
                      UNITS:      N/A
                      TYPE:       INTEGER
                      DIMENSION:  Scalar
