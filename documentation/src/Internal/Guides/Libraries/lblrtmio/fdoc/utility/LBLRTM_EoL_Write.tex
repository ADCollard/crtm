  NAME:
        LBLRTM_EoL_Write
 
  PURPOSE:
        Function to write an end-of-layer (EoL) marker to an output
        LBLRTM format file.
 
  CALLING SEQUENCE:
        Error_Status = LBLRTM_EoL_Write( FileID )
 
  INPUTS:
        FileId:        The unit number for the already open LBLRTM file.
                       UNITS:      N/A
                       TYPE:       INTEGER
                       DIMENSION:  Scalar
                       ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN)
 
  FUNCTION RESULT:
        Error_Status: The return value is an integer defining the error status.
                      The error codes are defined in the Message_Handler module.
                      If == SUCCESS the LBLRTM file EOL write was successful
                         == FAILURE an unrecoverable error occurred
                      UNITS:      N/A
                      TYPE:       INTEGER
                      DIMENSION:  Scalar
 
  SIDE EFFECTS:
