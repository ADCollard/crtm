  NAME:
        LBLRTM_Panel_Read
 
  PURPOSE:
        Function to read an LBLRTM panel from an LBLRTM format
        file.
 
  CALLING SEQUENCE:
        Error_Status = LBLRTM_Panel_Read( &
                         LBLRTM_Panel, &
                         FileId      , &
                         EOF         , &
                         Double_Panel = Double_Panel, &
                         Quiet        = Quiet         )
 
  OBJECTS:
        LBLRTM_Panel:  LBLRTM panel object to hold the data.
                       UNITS:      N/A
                       TYPE:       LBLRTM_Panel_type
                       DIMENSION:  Scalar
                       ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(OUT)
 
  INPUTS:
        FileId:        The unit number for the already open LBLRTM file.
                       UNITS:      N/A
                       TYPE:       INTEGER
                       DIMENSION:  Scalar
                       ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN)
 
  OUTPUTS:
        EOF:           Integer flag indicating end-of-file status for the
                       LBLRTM format file after the read. Valid return values
                       are defined in the LBLRTM_Parameters module.
                       If == LBLRTM_FILE_EOF:   End-Of-File has been reached.
                                                The file is then closed.
                          == LBLRTM_FILE_OK:    No EOF or EOL condition. The
                                                next read should be the panel
                                                data.
                          == LBLRTM_FILE_UNDEF: An error occurred. The file is
                                                closed.
                       UNITS:      N/A
                       TYPE:       INTEGER
                       DIMENSION:  Scalar
                       ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(OUT)
 
  OPTIONAL INPUTS:
        Double_Panel:  Set this logical flag to indicate a double-panel file.
                       If == .FALSE., the file is assumed to be single panel. [DEFAULT]
                          == .TRUE.,  the file is assumed to be double panel.
                       If not specified, default is .FALSE.
                       UNITS:      N/A
                       TYPE:       LOGICAL
                       DIMENSION:  Scalar
                       ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN), OPTIONAL
 
        Quiet:         Set this logical argument to suppress INFORMATION
                       messages being printed to stdout
                       If == .FALSE., INFORMATION messages are OUTPUT [DEFAULT].
                          == .TRUE.,  INFORMATION messages are SUPPRESSED.
                       If not specified, default is .FALSE.
                       UNITS:      N/A
                       TYPE:       LOGICAL
                       DIMENSION:  Scalar
                       ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN), OPTIONAL
 
  FUNCTION RESULT:
        Error_Status:  The return value is an integer defining the error status.
                       The error codes are defined in the Message_Handler module.
                       If == SUCCESS the LBLRTM panel read was successful
                          == FAILURE an error occurred
                       UNITS:      N/A
                       TYPE:       INTEGER
                       DIMENSION:  Scalar
 
  SIDE EFFECTS:
        If an error occurs or the end-of-file is encountered, the input file is
        closed.
